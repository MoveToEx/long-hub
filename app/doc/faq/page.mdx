#### Why cannot I copy an entire GIF?

Due to the limitation of Async Clipboard API, the only format available via browser clipboard api is `text/plain`, `text/html` and `image/png`.  
This limitation helps improve security by forbidding some files that may be harmful to system, but also makes it impossible to copy other formats.  
Chrome added custom format in Chrome 108 which allows for custom clipboard format by adding a `web` prefix, but this is only used for internal communication of a single application and does not lift the limitation when it comes to inter-application paste.
