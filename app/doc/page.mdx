Welcome to LONG Hub, a site focusing on collecting LONG images.  

This website is designed for IM software usage scenarios. You're welcomed to open this site when logging in your favorite IM app and search for an image whenever you encounter any messages, insulting or not.  

Each image is given three basic metadata: Text, tag and aggressiveness.  

Text is the field containing the text on the image as long as it is identifiable.  
Tag is some topic, element, visual effect, etc that some images share.  
Aggressive is a number ranging between 0 and 10 inclusively, measuring how aggressive or insulting an image is.  

On pages with grid image layout (like Index), you can hold Ctrl and click an image to copy it.  
Note that it takes some time to fetch the original image.  
When copying by this means, keep the page focused until you see the copy success prompt. The clipboard API requires the page to be focused when manipulating clipboard.
