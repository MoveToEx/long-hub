## GET /api/post/search

Search for posts that match a group of selectors. 

A group of selectors is an `Array` containing an arbitrary number of selectors. However, this api will return a 400 Bad Request when the length of selectors is greather than 24 or less than 1.  

A selector is defined as an object containing constraints on post metadata.  
A selector has a `type` and a `value` field, and an optional `op`(operator) field.  

- `type="text"`: Applies to text metadata. Looks for posts that contains `%value` as a part of its text.  
- `type="aggr"`: Applies to aggressiveness metadata. Looks for posts with aggressiveness that falls within a given range. Requires the `op` field present and the `value` field a number.  
    - `op="gt"`: Looks for posts with `aggr > value`  
    - `op="lt"`: Looks for posts with `aggr < value`  
    - `op="gte"`: Looks for posts with `aggr >= value`  
    - `op="lte"`: Looks for posts with `aggr <= value`  
    - `op="eq"`: Looks for posts with `aggr == value`  
    - `op="ne"`: Looks for posts with `aggr != value`  
- `type="tag"`: Applies to tag metadata. Looks for posts that are tagged or not tagged with a tag. Requires `op` field.  
    - `op="include"`: Looks for posts tagged with `value`  
    - `op="exclude"`: Looks for posts not tagged with `value`
