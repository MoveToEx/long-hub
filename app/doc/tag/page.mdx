Before all this, remeber that all the guidelines below serve for the same purpose of making posts as easily found through search page as possible.  
Entries below are generalized guidelines that cannot take every possible image into consideration. Violate them when necessary.

# Texting

Text is a field representing the texts that the image contains.  
Enter text in accordance to the image. Do not make additions or deletions .

When entering text, follow the guidelines below:

- Text may not contain space characters. If there's visible spaces between two characters, ignore them.
- Correct any typos should they exist.
- For blocks of text that are put on different areas of an image, arbitrary order is allowed as long as text of each block remains ordered.
- If an image does not contain identifiable text, leave the input box blank.
- If an image contains languages other than Simplified Chinese and English, translate them into proper Chinese equivalent.
- If an image contains emojis as parts of its text, replace the emoji with proper representations.
- Text may not contain punctuation, unless the punctuation is used not only for separating purposes (like "@" used to mention someone in group chat).

# Tagging

Tag is a field representing elements and characteristics of an image.  

When tagging an image, follow the guidelines below:

- Tags must be written in English and must not contain characters other than digits, lowercase letters and underline(_).
- If an image contains elements from a certain topic (game, anime, ..., usually described as `parody` in gallery websites), tag it with the English translation of the topic.
- If an image is mostly used to convey a certain kind of emotion, include that emotion as a tag. (e.g. `disapproving`, `jealous`, ...)
- Principally tags of an image should contain most of the visual elements of an image.  

<br />

Below is a list of tags and their corresponding criteria:  

- `monochrome`: Image contains no other color apart from black, gray and white. Note that green color caused by image compression does not affect this tag.
- `variation`: Image is a variation of a template, i.e. can be obtained by adding certain elements to a base image.
- `nsfw`: Image contains NSFW elements (e.g. penis and provocative text).
- `meaningless`: Image does not contain identifiable meaning.
- `gif`: Animated image of gif format.
- `long_text`: Image contains significantly more text than a usual one does (usually more than 30 to 50 characters/words).
