# Texting
When entering text, follow the guidelines below:

- Text may not contain spacing characters. If there's visible spaces between two characters, ignore them.
- If an image does not contain identifiable text, leave the input box blank.
- If an image contains text longer than 50 characters, tag the image with 'long_text'.
- If an image contains languages other than Simplified Chinese and English, translate them into proper Chinese equivalent.
- If an image contains emojis as parts of its text, replace the emoji into proper Chinese characters.
- Text may not contain punctuation, unless the punctuation is used not only for separating (like "@" used to mention someone in group chat).
- Stick to the image. If the image contains typo or the like, leave it as is.

# Tagging
When tagging an image, follow the guidelines below:

- Tags must be written in English and must not contain characters other than digits, lowercase letters and underline(_). Multiple tags are separated with comma(,).
- When uploading, it does not matter if there're spaces before or after a tag, as they will be trimmed off.
- If an image contains elements from a certain topic (game, anime, ..., usually described as `parody` in gallery websites), tag it with the English translation of the topic.
- If an image is mostly used to convey a certain kind of emotion, use that emotion as a tag. (e.g. `disapproving`, `jealous`, ...)
- Tag according to what the image contains.

Below is a list of tags and their corresponding criteria:  

- `monochrome`: Image contains no other color apart from black, gray and white. Note that green color caused by image compression does not affect this tag.
- `variation`: Image is a variation of a template, i.e. can be obtained by adding certain elements to a base image.
- `nsfw`: Image contains NSFW elements (e.g. penis and provocative text).
- `meaningless`: Image does not contain identifiable meaning.
