By uploading, users of LONG Hub can contribute to our collection and help it keep flourishing.  

## Before uploading

There are several notes:  

- Avoid disgusting content. It may sound absurd for images centered on insulting others, but we still hope you could avoid images that most people would not like to see.  
- Check for potential dups using [Find similar](/post/similar). Do not upload an image if there's already one containing nearly the same content.  

## When uploading

Enter Text and Tags according to respective document entries.  
Aggressive is a rather subjective field, and it is hard to guarantee a uniform standard for this. Do your best.  

Note that when entering tags, the text being entered does not count as a tag.
You have to press enter or select a tag from the dropdown menu (making the text become a chip) to actually enter a tag.  

The rating component used in Aggressiveness can be set to 0 by clicking the already selected value again.
