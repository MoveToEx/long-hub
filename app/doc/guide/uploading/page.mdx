## Before uploading

There are several notes:  

- Avoid disgusting content. It may sound absurd for images centered on insulting others, but we still hope you could avoid images that most people would not like to see.  
- Check for potential dups using [Find similar](/post/similar). Do not upload an image if there's already one containing nearly the same content.  

## When uploading

Enter Text and Tags according to respective document entries.  
Aggressive is a rather subjective field, and it is hard to guarantee a uniform standard for this. Do your best.  

Note that when entering tags, the text being entered does not count as a tag.
You have to press enter or select a tag from the dropdown menu (making the text become a chip) to actually enter a tag.  

The rating component used in Aggressiveness can be set to 0 by clicking the already selected value again.  

If you do not feel like writing text or tags for some reason, click the third button of the upload page.  
This will upload every selected file and leave them blank, tagging each one with a "tagme" tag. (aka blank upload)  
In this mode, images that have potential dups get directly rejected.  
This means is however strongly opposed of. It should only be used when tagging is abnormally inconvenient, and is promised to be done later.  
Do not rely on blank upload for every image you upload. This is not intended for, nor should it be used for leaving your responsibility for others.  
If you feel too lazy to tag, take it easy and do not upload at all.

Restrictions on blank posts have been taken into consideration, and will possibly be implemented in the future.
